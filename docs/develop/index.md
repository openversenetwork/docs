# Overview

## Why develop dApps on Openverse?

The Openverse Core Development Team is on a mission to provide the foundational tools necessary for building the cross-chain
applications of the future, freeing developers from the confines of todayâ€™s siloed blockchains.

Openverse focuses on cross-chain **innovation** so that developers can build entirely new dApp experiences for their users.
Deploying smart contracts on Openverse is **easy**, as the Openverse blockchain is fully compatible with Ethereum and its rich
ecosystem of robust tooling, wallets, explorers, a surplus of assets, and intelligent end-users. At the same time,
Openverse allows developers to build **scalable** EVM dApp chains with the upcoming Openverse SDK and it hosts one of the
most active community governance that seeks **fairness** across all key actors (users, builders, and validators).

Openverse does this by leveraging the interoperability of the Cosmos Ecosystem and the market-dominating support for EVM
development. This allows dApp developers to use Ethereum smart contracts to implement the business logic on-chain
while having access to Cosmos chain functionalities, such as exchanging value with the rest of the Cosmos Ecosystem
through the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

## How to build a dApp

Following this documentation and our academy you can learn how to build a dApp on Openverse and become part of the rich
ecosystem of EVM builders on Cosmos. Whether you are building new use cases on Openverse or porting an existing dApp from
another chain, you can learn how to
[build and deploy smart contracts](./develop/build-a-dApp/build-smart-contracts) and what
[tools](./tools/index.md) are available to build a web3
[frontend](./develop/build-a-dApp/build-a-frontend#wallet-integration) and
[backend](./develop/create-backend) to create a seamless web3 experience for users of your dApp on Openverse.

Once tested on [Testnet](./../develop/testnet) and deployed on [Mainnet](./../develop/mainnet), you can
start [earning an income](./../develop/mainnet#revenue) on transaction fees from interacting with your dApp or
[register your tokens](./../develop/mainnet#token-registration) for cross-chain use.

## Contributors

You can also contribute to the Openverse ecosystem without building a dApp. Head over to [tools](./tools/index.md) to learn
how to contribute as a full-stack developer by building new dev tools or [protocol](../protocol) to help
out building the core protocol.
