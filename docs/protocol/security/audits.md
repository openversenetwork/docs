# Audits

Openverse is connecting two major worlds in the crypto universe by enabling
compatibility between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.
This does not come without its difficulties, and security always
is a top priority for the Openverse developers.

Each feature is extensively tested and internally audited by the team
before being brought to the users.
However, external audits are a valuable and necessary assurance for the
security of the protocol itself and with that,
also for anyone deploying on or using Openverse.

## Publicly Available Audits

This page lists the publicly available audits,
that have been conducted on the Openverse and Ethermint codebases:
